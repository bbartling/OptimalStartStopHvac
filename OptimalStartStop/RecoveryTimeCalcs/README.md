## Recovery Time Calcs

This Python script processes HVAC zone temperature data to identify and analyze warm-up phases, where the temperature rises to reach an occupied setpoint. It begins by loading the data, converting timestamps for time-based operations, and setting the index for resampling. The script calculates daily setpoints by finding the mean of maximum and minimum temperatures, defining the **occupied_threshold** and **unoccupied_threshold**. Using these thresholds, it identifies **steep increases** in temperature and periods when the temperature is near the occupied setpoint. A loop tracks the **warm-up phase** based on these conditions, marking it active when a steep increase is detected and inactive once the temperature stabilizes near the setpoint. To refine results, a rolling window smooths the data to remove isolated `True` values in the `Warm_Up_Active` column, which might be outliers or noise. 

The script calculates the total warm-up duration for each day by summing the intervals where warm-up is active, converting the count to minutes based on the time interval (e.g., 5 minutes per reading). It outputs the daily warm-up durations and plots the results as a bar chart, providing an intuitive visualization of daily warm-up activity. Additionally, the script highlights periods of warm-up activity on a time-series plot of the zone temperature, showing the relationship between the temperature profile and warm-up phases. This combination of calculations and visualizations offers insights into the warm-up behavior of HVAC systems over time.
