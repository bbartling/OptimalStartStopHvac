## Traditional Optimal Start

The **Optimized Start Algorithm** determines the appropriate time to start HVAC equipment to achieve desired comfort levels by the next scheduled occupancy time. The algorithm considers the current space temperature, desired comfort limits, and runtime required per degree of heating or cooling. If the space temperature is above the upper comfort limit, the lead time is calculated based on the cooling runtime required to reduce the temperature to within the comfort range. Similarly, if the space temperature is below the lower comfort limit, the lead time is based on the heating runtime needed to raise the temperature. The calculated lead time determines the command time, ensuring it does not start earlier than the predefined earliest allowable start time. In its current form, the algorithm operates as **non-adaptive**, relying on static parameters (e.g., runtime per degree and comfort limits) without considering historical data or dynamic adjustments. However, it effectively balances comfort and energy efficiency by ensuring the system starts only as early as necessary to meet comfort requirements.
