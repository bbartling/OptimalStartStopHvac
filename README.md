# OptimalStartStopHvac
Pseudocode for implementing linear interpolation for HVAC optimal start: The goal is to input the current outdoor air temperature, zone air temperature, and start times recorded from previous optimal start processes to provide a simple yet effective method for calculating the minutes needed to warm up or cool down zones. This approach optimizes the HVAC system by adaptively learning building characteristics and adjusting based on factors such as the relationship between outdoor and indoor air temperatures.

## interpolate_start_minutes function

This function calculates the optimal HVAC start time by analyzing current outside air and zone temperatures against historical data and using **weighted interpolation**. The historical data contains past outside temperatures, zone temperatures, and the corresponding start times (in minutes) needed to warm or cool the space before occupancy. The function begins by calculating the "distance" between the current conditions and each historical record. Distance is measured as the sum of the absolute differences between the current outside temperature and zone temperature and the historical values. These distances represent how close past conditions are to the current situation. The function then sorts the distances in ascending order and selects the two closest points. If thereâ€™s only one close point, the corresponding start time is returned directly. Otherwise, a weighted average of the two closest start times is calculated, with weights based on the inverse of the distances. This gives more importance to the historical points that are closer to the current conditions. Finally, the interpolated start time is rounded and returned as the optimal value, ensuring an accurate and smooth estimate for pre-occupancy warm-up or cool-down. This approach works efficiently for varying weather conditions and ensures reliable HVAC system operation.

### **Pseudocode: Linear Interpolation for HVAC Optimal Start**

```
FUNCTION interpolate_start_minutes(historical_data, current_outside_temp, current_zone_temp, default_minutes=60):

    IF historical_data is EMPTY:
        RETURN default_minutes   // Fallback if no historical data is available

    INITIALIZE distances as an empty list

    FOR EACH record in historical_data:
        (outside_temp, zone_temp, start_minutes) = record
        distance = ABS(current_outside_temp - outside_temp) + ABS(current_zone_temp - zone_temp)
        APPEND (distance, start_minutes) to distances

    SORT distances in ascending order by distance value

    SELECT closest = first two records from sorted distances

    // Handle edge case where only one data point exists
    IF length of closest == 1:
        RETURN closest[0].start_minutes

    // Extract two closest points
    (distance1, minutes1) = closest[0]
    (distance2, minutes2) = closest[1]

    // Compute weights as inverse of distances
    weight1 = 1 / distance1 IF distance1 != 0 ELSE 1
    weight2 = 1 / distance2 IF distance2 != 0 ELSE 1

    // Perform weighted interpolation
    interpolated_minutes = ((minutes1 * weight1) + (minutes2 * weight2)) / (weight1 + weight2)

    RETURN ROUND(interpolated_minutes)
```


### **Key Notes:**
1. **Inputs**:  
   - `historical_data`: List of tuples containing past `(outside_temp, zone_temp, start_minutes)`.  
   - `current_outside_temp` and `current_zone_temp`: Current sensor readings.  
   - `default_minutes`: A fallback value if historical data is unavailable.  

2. **Logic**:  
   - Compute the **distance** between current and historical conditions.  
   - Sort distances and pick the two closest points.  
   - Use **inverse distance weighting** to interpolate the start time, ensuring closer points have more influence.  

3. **Outputs**:  
   - Returns an interpolated HVAC start time rounded to the nearest integer.  


### **High-Level Flow**:
1. If no data, return default start time.  
2. Calculate distances to find closest historical conditions.  
3. Sort and select the two closest points.  
4. Use weighted interpolation to estimate start time.  
5. Return the result.
